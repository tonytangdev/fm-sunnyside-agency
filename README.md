### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

- How to create a responsive navbar with Tailwind and Headless UI
- Image optimization with [NextJS/Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image)

### Continued development

I took more time than I expected to finish this project. During the development, I lost motivation to do it all.
In order to gather some motivation, I chunked the work into small pieces. I would ddo a small piece everyday instead of doing everything all at once.

It keeps me motivated to do small amount of work everyday.

In the future, I should start by chunking the project in small pieces and take time to do them instead of rushing the project.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/#components) - This helped me to create a responsive menu
